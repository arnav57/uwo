# Augustus (Ocatavian)

This chapter details the first week of content specifically important things about Augustus

The dictator Caesar was assasinated in 43 BCE, and octavian rose to power over the following years.
A key idea here is that Rome was never *meant* to be a monarchy, it was supposed to be a republic of the people. So Octavian had to fill this void left by Caesars death and be the first of his kind to be a dictator as well.

Some of the sources and readings from this Chapter are covered below

- Rae Gestae of Augustus (Autobiography on bronze written by augustus himself)
- Suetonious (70 CE, well after augustus dies)
- Tacitus (58 CE)
- Cassius Dio (164 CE)

Augustus real name was \kw{Gaius Octavius}, he only dons the title of Augustus later in his life.

He is biologically the great-nephew of the late Caesar. And after Caesar dies, he is named as his heir.

After Caesar's Death there were a string of things that happened, as Octavian strived to *avenge his "father's" death*.

There are a string of 5 civil wars (44 - 31 BCE), the events of are below. Before we get started on these battles.

After the battle of Matina, three came together to form the \kw{second triumvirate}. They came together with the goal of establishing the republic. They shared absolute power over Rome for 10 years. The group consists of

- Octavian (the main character)
- Marc Antony (Caesars best friend)
- Lepidus (the biggest cuck of this time period)

These 3 could basically do whatever they wanted (enact laws, finalize legal judgements). They also got to choose the entire roman government, hence having absolute power over Rome.

1. Matina (43 BCE)

Ocatavian fought against Marc Anthony to defend the assassins of Caesar. This makes no sense but he prob did this to get Marc Anthony out of the way as Octavian wanted to become Consul.

As a result of this battle, both current Consuls were killed, and Octavian was named *sole* Consul of the empire, which is irregular.


2. Phillipi (42 BCE)

A year after the triumvirate was formed, Antony and Octavian defeated Cassius and Brutus (assasins) over two battles here.

3. Perusia (41 BCE)

Right after both Antony and Octavian worked togeher, here in Perusia a year later, Octavian beseieged Antonys brother
Lucius.

This shows the tension between these two figures. After this battle finished Octavian basically killed 300 senators/equestrians, after they begged him for their lives he became the alpha wolf and told them "you must die".

After this battle The empire was mainly divided into two main sections of east and west. Where they were rules by Octavian and Antony respectively. The cuck (lepidus) was given africa as an afterthought lol. This deal was made  in a town called Brundisium

4. Naulochus (40 BCE)

Here Octavian defeated the son of Pompeii the great, and after this the cuck was banished to his chair for life (a small island named Circae?)

5. Actium (31 BCE)

Ocatavian and Antony's relationship deteriorated until this point, and Octavian portrayed Antony as a outsider by openly reading his will, where Antony declared Cleopatra (his egyptian wife, seen as an outsider) as his heir. This was irregular back at the time.

They met in battle here, and Octavian won. After this Antony and Cleopatra fled to Alexandria where they both killed themselves. Octavian followed them, and killed their eldest son, but spared the younger son and daughter. He also killed Caesarion (the son of Caesar and Cleopatra) killed. Is this really him *avenging his father*?
